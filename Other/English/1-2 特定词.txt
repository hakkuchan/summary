1-2 特定词

· 特定词是指在写作过程中，用细节描述去充分解释一些概念
  
  例如：
  
  To excel in college, you'll have to work hard.

  细节描述：To excel in college, you' ll need to go to every class, 
  do all your reading before you go, write several drafts of each paper 
  and review your notes for each class weekly.
 
 · 提高方法：积累较好的细节描写段落，并从仿写开始，过渡到自己发挥。
